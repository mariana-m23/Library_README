# Library_README
### A program that was created for the libraries of SmallTownX, it includes a new electronic rental system. The program displays the many books that are offered to be borrowed by three libraries in the towwn.
 #### This porgram was created by Isabella and Mariana M. Lozano

#### Description: 
The program we created uses the Library and Book classes that were proivded at the beginning.

#### Usage: 
   The user is able to utilize this program to find the information of the three libraries in SmallTownX, as the libraries hours, location, and books available are able to be viewed by the user.

#### Development: 
 We were able to develop this program by using all that was provided from the start. We began with the use of the two skeleton classes, and then began to figure out how to find the missing pieces that would allow the main method to function. We built a class that would represent the three libraries and manage the collection of books to make it easier for the user to navigate the site. Additionally, by using this action, the user can search for a book and receive a response indicating the whereaboutsÂ of the book, whether it is borrowed at the moment or it is in the second library.
